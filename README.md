# trajectory-optimization-techniques-for-reactive-obstacle-avoidance

This Project explores optimizing robotic trajectories in dynamic environments using Via-Point based Stochastic Trajectory Optimization (VPSTO) with a custom distribution. Simulations and real-hardware tests show that the custom distribution improves trajectory smoothness and adaptability, especially in dynamic scenarios with moving obstacles. VPSTO with the custom distribution enhances responsiveness, making it a valuable contribution to robotic motion planning.
